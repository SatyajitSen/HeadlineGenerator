# HeadlineGenerator
Generates reasonable headlines based on the words in an article using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Original code forked from https://github.com/udibr/headlines. Worked with David Liedtka, a Naval Cryptologic Warfare Officer and a scholar.

NOTE:
- Our dataset, all .pkl files (data.pkl, vocabulary-embedding.pkl, vocabulary-embedding-data.pkl), and our trained weights file (train.hdf5) were too large for a GitHub upload
- We preprocessed our dataset into the data.pkl file using our generate_pkl script
